Use Case of AI in the finance Industry: 

Usage patterns and spending habits, usually, if there are weird transactions that don’t relate to the normal norms within your usage patterns, there can be an AI model that tracks a users spending patterns and deciphers what should be blocked or what should be allowed.

Key idea: AI tracks how you usually spend. If a transaction doesn’t match these patterns, it’s flagged as suspicious. Example: You normally spend $200 at grocery stores, but a sudden $2,000 charge at a luxury retailer triggers an alert for potential fraud.

1.	Credit scoring and risk assessments: In the past, financial institutions, have to do a hard or soft check on your credit for you to know your credit score. Now AI does not need to do any check on your credit, it doesn't even need your social security. With AI, just from gathered data about the user, an expense analysis is done from the data gotten like what kind of expenses occur, how many credit cards the user pays, what the mortgage is, and with likewise data, a credit assessment and a risk assessment is done in order to help banks or financial institutions determine a customers creditworthiness and default risk.

Sentiment analysis: AI gauges public opinion on 	companies or markets by scanning news and social media. 	Example: A bank checks if online chatter around a startup 	is positive or negative before deciding to invest.



2.	Market Structure/Analysis: AI examines how different market segments (like tech vs. retail) are performing to guide investment decisions. Example: A bank sees consumers shifting to online shopping and invests in an e-commerce payment startup.



3.	Market predictions through Manipulated patterns/ Algorithm trading, market predictions through manipulated patterns: AI-driven trading algorithms detect trends and unusual activity that may signal market manipulation (e.g., false demand). Example: An AI sees a sudden spike in a stock’s trading volume with no supporting news, flags it as potential manipulation, and warns traders before they invest.

4.	Customer service Automation: uses AI-based tools - like chat bots, voice assistants, and personalized recommendations to handle common inquiries and tasks, providing faster, 24/7 support without needing a human agent.

Categories: 
1) AI Chatbots: Handle common questions (e.g., checking 			balances) anytime. Example: A chatbot that helps 			you dispute an unexpected fee at midnight, no 				human agent needed.

2) Voice assistance: Uses voice commands for tasks like 			bill payments. Example: You say “Pay my credit card” 			on a phone line, and AI completes the transaction.

3) Personalized financial advice: AI looks at your spending 			and suggests tailored budgeting or investment tips. 			Example: Your banking app recommends 					automatically moving $200 a month into a savings 			account based on your spending habits.
